# UPDATE: Revamp in the works!

Accessibility concerns with the existing design were [graciously brought to our attention](https://github.com/ryannhg/elm-in-the-spring/issues/5). We're working to release a snazzy update very soon!

Feel free to checkout out the (cleaned up!!) code [here](https://github.com/elm-in-the-spring/conference-2019) ðŸ‘€ .
